In this demo, we present FusionNexus, an asymmetric collaboration experience where a virtual-world player needs to guide a real-world player to make certain actions. A machine learning algorithm was used to do the pose detection of the real-world player. We collect the virtual-world playerâ€™s heartbeat to control drum beats in background music played to the real-world player to convey emotional status of the virtual-world player. In this demonstration, two players will collaborate to accomplish a time task.
