# About Me

Hello! I'm Zirui. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong [(Synteraction Lab)](https://synteraction.org/) under Professor Zhao's supervision.

## Skills and Interests

As a software engineer, I'm fascinated by the architectural design of large-scale and complex software systems. I love exploring the integration of diverse software and hardware solutions to push technological boundaries. My expertise extends to:

- Software engineering
    * Especially Development in XR (Extended Reality)
- Network engineering
- Music production, particularly in EDM and Pop genres
- Playing keyboard and electric guitar

An interesting fact: My first research project combined my passions for VR and music production!

## Research Experience

My research journey began with the FusionNexus project at the [Empathic Computing Lab (ECL)](https://empathiccomputing.org/). This innovative project involved guiding real-world actions through a virtual interface and translating biometric data into music.

Subsequently, I interned at ECL, where I:
1. Investigated the impact of different input methods in AR, VR, and MR on drawing accuracy and user comfort.
2. Focused on analyzing spatial data and biological signals to develop objective data metrics for HCI studies.

## Current Research and Interests

My current research interests include:
- Large-scale mixed reality systems for collaboration, especially in remote settings
- Developing reliable objective data metrics by combining spatial data with other data types, such as biological signals

## Personal Note

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology and research, you might find me composing music or jamming with friends. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches and am always excited to explore how technology can intersect with other fields to create innovative solutions.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research, technology, or even trade some music production tips!
